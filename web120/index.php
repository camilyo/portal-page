    <p><b>Hey,</b></p>
    
    <p>I am Camila Christensen, I grew up in SÃ£o Paulo, considered a vibrant financial center and one of the most populous city in Brazil.  I've moved to Seattle almost 5 years ago. During a conference in 2017, I took my first programming class and it totally blew my mind. </p>
        
    <p> I am currently pursuing a Programming degree at Seattle Central College and exploring the career option I have. In my free time, I love going to the mountains. It helps me to relax. It nourishes my mind, body and soul.</p>
