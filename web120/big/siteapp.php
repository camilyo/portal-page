    <p> The number of mobile users today has increased compared to desktop users. Consequently, businesses have realized the need of mobile channels to increase communication or attract customers by opting out for a responsive website or creating a mobile app. What is the best approach for your business? Before we can dive deeply into the pros and cons, we have to understand the difference between them. According to Modo Labs (2015) “Responsively designed sites present the whole website, with the same general-purpose content and organization you could access from a desktop device. Native apps, on the other hand, take the mobile experience to the next level. At their best, they do more than just repackage existing content and functionality; they also present navigation, content, and functionality in a way specifically optimized for the measurably different ways in which people actually use their mobile devices.”</p>

    <p>While some large business can afford to employ both responsive websites and mobile apps, other companies will have to choose between the two options. Here is a comparison between them:</p>
 
    <table class="audience">
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Responsive</th>
            <th>Mobile App</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Time </b></td>
            <td>
                  Launching a mobile site is faster, since developers will need to adapt part of the code to make it work in small devices.
                
            </td>
            <td>
                  The development team has to create a unique design and codebase for each operating system which takes time.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Cost </b></td>
            <td>
                  Comparatively cheap when compared to a mobile app built from the ground up.
            </td>
            <td>
                  The cost of building a app from ground up is high.  It requires a different set of skills that the web development team might not have.
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Functionality </b></td>
            <td>
                  Responsive websites are slower and not as functional as an app, but the same code will be compatible with multiple mobile platforms and devices.
            </td>
            <td>
                  It is faster and functional, and it can easily integrate with other features and tools in a device. But it will require to be supported by multiple mobile platforms and devices.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>Now, that you understand the difference between a responsive website and a mobile app, it is important to consider few points before making you choice: </p>
    
    <ol>
    <li>How important speed and performance would be?</li>
    <li>Your budget and the estimate time of development?</li>
    <li>Are you planning to use other device features?</li></ol>
    
    <p>Companies needs to consider how each solution can help them reach the business goals. Preparing and researching before you make a decision will help ensure the route you take will be the right one.</p>
