    <p> Adding an photo gallery to your site will make your site more attractive and help you engage with your visitor. In many cases, it is also a great way to bring customers closer to your product/service in a way they will greatly appreciate, specially if they are displayed in a stylish way or with transitions and customization options. According to Sarah Smith, "that’s where a photo gallery can become indispensable for putting your physical products right in front of your customers’ eyes. The best part is that this can become an integral part of your business’s digital marketing strategy or one you can simply set and forget once every quarter". Imagine you have a photography company, you can tell your customers the photography area you are specialized, the price you charge per session and the benefits they will have by choosing your services. Although, your customers might want to see the physical product. They might want to know how beautiful it is and if that is really what they are looking for.</p>
    
    <p>W3Schools gives a us a simple example of a HTML gallery: </p>
    <div class="code">
    <pre>

        div.gallery {
            margin: 5px; 
            border: 1px solid #ccc; 
            float: left; 
            width: 180px; 
        } <br />

        div.gallery:hover { 
            border: 1px solid #777; 
        }<br />

        div.gallery img { 
            width: 100%; 
            height: auto; 
        } <br />

        div.desc { 
            padding: 15px; 
            text-align: center; 
        }

    </pre>

    <pre>
    <code>

    &lt;div class="gallery"&gt;
        &lt;a target="_blank" href="img_forest.jpg"&gt;
            &lt;img src="img_forest.jpg" 
            alt="Forest" width="600" height="400"&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;div class="desc">Add a description of 
          the image here&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="gallery"&gt;
          &lt;a target="_blank" href="img_lights.jpg"&gt;
            &lt;img src="img_lights.jpg" 
            alt="Northern Lights" width="600" height="400"&gt;
          &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;div class="desc">Add a description 
          of the image here&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="gallery"&gt;
          &lt;a target="_blank" href="img_mountains.jpg"&gt;
            &lt;img src="img_mountains.jpg" 
            alt="Mountains" width="600" height="400"&gt;
         &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;div class="desc">Add a description 
          of the image here&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

    </code>
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>To make the code more interactive, some authors suggest the use of JavaScript. There are numerous types of slide options that can be used, from a easy touch slider to a more complex FractionSlider jQuery plugin that helps you to animate various elements per slide with control of every aspect of time and animation. As BeginDot mentions “across the internet, you can see them being in use on some blogs and websites. Image sliders are a fabulous way to attract anyone who visits your blog and also make your blog look beautiful. Apart from that, adding sliders could provide an attractive layout to your already basic website. And you need not worry about the working of the sliders because most of them work quite well on mobile devices as well.” The two most important things you need to know before choosing the best design for your website is to make sure it will be responsible to work in different devices and it  is search engine optimized for you to rank higher in Google.</p>
